### 4. Core Services Implemented

#### AuthService (with Signals)

- JWT token management (sessionStorage)
- User state using Angular Signals
- Login/logout/register methods
- Token refresh on 401
- Computed properties: `isAuthenticated`, `isAdmin`, `userFullName`
- Auto-save to sessionStorage on state changes

#### ApiService (HTTP Wrapper)

- Generic CRUD methods: `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `patch()`, `delete()`
- File upload support: `uploadFile()`, `uploadFiles()` with FormData
- Centralized error handling

#### JWT Interceptor

- Adds `Authorization: Bearer {token}` to all requests
- Automatic token refresh on 401 response
- Queues pending requests during refresh
- Handles refresh failures gracefully

#### Error Interceptor

- Converts HTTP errors to user-friendly messages
- Handles network errors, validation errors, unauthorized, forbidden
- Logs errors to console for debugging

### 6. Placeholder Pages Created

#### Login Component

- Email + password form with client-side validation
- Styled with Tailwind responsive grid

## 📋 Ready for Phase 2

The following are **ready to implement** in Phase 2:

- [ ] ProductService with Signals store + CRUD operations
- [ ] ProductsListComponent (table, pagination, filters)
- [ ] ProductFormComponent (create/edit with image upload)
- [ ] OrderService with real-time WebSocket updates
- [ ] OrdersListComponent (table with status filtering)
- [ ] CategoryService + components
- [ ] UserService + components
- [ ] DashboardService with WebSocket stats updates

## ⚠️ Known Limitations / Future Improvements

1. **ngx-sonner**: Imported but not yet used (ready for Phase 2)
2. **WebSocket**: Service created but not subscribed in components yet
3. **Signals**: Using Angular 19+ Signals syntax (no observables in state)
4. **Styling**: Placeholder pages use basic Tailwind grid - polish needed
5. **FormData**: Image upload infrastructure ready; component form not yet built
6. **SessionStorage**: Tokens stored in sessionStorage (good for security; consider HttpOnly in Phase 2)

---

✅ Tailwind v3 working with custom theme  
✅ Feature-based architecture in place  
✅ Core services (Auth, API, WebSocket) fully functional
